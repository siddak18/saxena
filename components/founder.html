          <p class="edit"> The year 2020 witnessed the arrival of <span>COVID-19</span> and <span>decline in education</span> for underprivileged kids. While my own classes remained unaffected, I noticed that underprivileged children in government schools were facing a <span>complete halt in their education</span>. Within a 2 km radius of my home, around 25% of the population were facing the same problem, and they were unable to continue their studies due to technological barriers. Even as the pandemic subsided,  I conducted surveys that revealed that their classes had still not resumed. <br> <br> In collaboration with Matrabhumi NGO, we took action. We <span>rented</span> five computers and provided them, along with Wi-Fi routers, to <span>community halls</span> in the slums. Recognizing that many teachers were not accustomed to online teaching, my team and I created <span>online lecture materials</span> to assist them and videos to guide them with <span>necessary digital skills</span> to navigate the internet, use software, or <span>troubleshoot technical issues</span> effectively. We organized students into batches and started <span>delivering science and math lessons</span> through these computers. <br> <br> Our small initiative yielded <span>significant results</span> as the children successfully passed their exams. This was the turning point that led to the <span>beginning of Uthaan’s journey</span>. <br> During the launch of my book, <span>“Amidst The Downpour”</span>  I made a commitment that the royalty earnings from my book would be dedicated to Uthaan's initiatives. Working alongside my dedicated team, <span>we raised awareness, offered support</span>, and experienced the profound satisfaction of bringing about smiles to the faces that needed it the most. <br> <br> With Uthaan and the team I had gathered, raising a voice for <span>awareness, holding hands promising assurance</span>, and that everlasting satisfaction to finally <span>bring the change</span> I always expected to be brought, felt like a <b> <i>victory </i> </b>.</p>
